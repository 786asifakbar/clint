        p={`A water treatment plant is a facility that processes raw water to make it safe for human consumption,
           industrial use, and environmental discharge. The main stages in water treatment include coagulation 
           and flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. These processes remove contaminants like
           bacteria, viruses, sediments, and chemicals, ensuring the water meets safety standards.

           Fixing Issues in Water Treatment Plants
           Fixing issues in water treatment plants involves several key steps:
           1. **Assessment and Diagnosis**: Identify the problems through inspections, testing water quality, and assessing the condition of equipment and infrastructure.
           2. **Maintenance and Upgrades**: Repair or replace faulty equipment, upgrade outdated systems, and implement new technologies to improve efficiency and reliability.`}
